1-Search for suitable companies in various domains that use recommender systems (see lecture 1 & 2). 
2-List them in your report and choose one or more as the data source for the assignment. 
3-Describe how the chosen company collects customer feedback and what rating type is used. 
4-Prepare the collected data and take the necessary preprocessing procedures to clean it and express the feedback in the form of integer values. 
5-Explain clearly the process you used to obtain and preprocess data, as well as the rating type.
6-Create your own user-item matrix and use it as the dataset for this assignment. 
7-Give a complete description of the created dataset. 
8-Compute the average rating and copy the results into your report under the "Assignment Results" section 
9-Give a complete background/overview about user-based and item-based CF algorithms, and their detailed analytical solutions. 
10-Compute the similarity using both the cosine similarity measure and the Pearson correlation coefficient to identify a peer group of users in the case of user-based CFs and a peer group of items in the case of item-based CFs. 
11-Compare the results of measuring similarity using similarity measure with the results using Pearson correlation coefficient and emphasizing the pros and cons of each technique. 
12-Copy the results into your report under the "Assignment Results” section. 
13-Compute the rating prediction and the top-N list of recommended users/products in case of user-based and item-based CF, each case must be performed using the cosine similarity measure and the Pearson correlation coefficient. 
14-Compare the results of the rating prediction and the top-N list of recommended users/products after performing step 14. 
15-Copy the results into your report under the "Assignment Results” section. 
16-Present, describe, compare, and evaluate the results in all cases. 
17-Briefly introduce the implementation process, tools and libraries. 
18-Write your own remarks about the perceived differences between user-based and item- based CF using the similarity measure and the Pearson correlation coefficient. 
19-Write a conclusion that demonstrates how each strategy affected predicted accuracy. 
20-Addresses any enhancement from your point of view.
